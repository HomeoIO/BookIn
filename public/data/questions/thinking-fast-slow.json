      "Fast and Slow",
      "Conscious and Subconscious",

    "correctAnswer": "Fast and Slow",
    "explanation": "System 1 is fast, automatic, and intuitive. System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and logical. These two systems work together but in different ways.",

    "question": "System 2 is lazy and often relies on System 1's suggestions. True or False?",
    "type": "true-false",
    "correctAnswer": "true",
    "explanation": "Kahneman argues that System 2 is 'lazy' and often accepts System 1's suggestions with minimal checking. This is why we fall prey to cognitive biases - System 2 doesn't always scrutinize System 1's quick judgments.",

    "correctAnswer": "The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information when making decisions",

      "The tendency to hold onto losing investments"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains",
    "explanation": "Loss aversion means that losses loom larger than gains - the pain of losing $100 is more intense than the pleasure of gaining $100. This is a fundamental principle of prospect theory.",

    "correctAnswer": "The tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions",

    "type": "true-false",
    "correctAnswer": "true",
    "explanation": "The framing effect shows that the way information is presented (framed) significantly affects decisions and judgments. For example, people react differently to '90% survival rate' vs '10% mortality rate' even though they're the same.",
